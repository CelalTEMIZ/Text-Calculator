# Text-Calculator in Assembly

- A program that reads the string starting from $1200 and computes the results accordingly.

- For instance if starting from $1200 the memory has the string “28.33 + 17.28=” then the program will compute the result and write it to address $1500.

- Strings always end with ‘=’. Put the string at $1200 using ORG and FCC directives.

- Store the integer and decimal parts in different memory locations and perform arithmetic operation accordingly.

- The arithmetic operation can be either ‘+’ or ‘-‘.
